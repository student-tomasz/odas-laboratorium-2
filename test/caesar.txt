In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as a Caesar's cipher, the shift
cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely
known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each
letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions
down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of three, A would be replaced by D,
B would become E, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used
it in his private correspondence.

The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part
of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenere cipher. As with all single
alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern
practice offers essentially no communication security.
